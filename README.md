# Data_Science_Portfolio_Oxford


An overview of various Data-Science related projects for my classes at UCLA or for my own enjoyment.

### [[01] Identifying Complementary Skills using Network Analysis](https://github.com/MariethCoetzer/Data_Science_Portfolio_Oxford/tree/main/%5B01%5D%20Identifying%20Complementary%20Skills%20using%20Network%20Analysis):
> Using network analysis to identify complementary skills on an online labour platform. The data and part of the analysis comes from [What is the price of a skill](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733323001828?via%3Dihub) by Fabian Stephany and Ole Teutloff. This work was carried out for Social Network Analysis during Hilary Term 2024 in Oxford.

### [[03] Predicting Grit in Adolescents using Machine Learning](https://github.com/MariethCoetzer/Data_Science_Portfolio_Oxford/tree/main/%5B03%5D%20Predicting%20Grit%20in%20Adolescents%20using%20Machine%20Learning):
> Leveraging 10,000 childhood features to predict adolescent grit including data cleaning, hyperparameter tuning, and interpreting model results using partial dependence plots and Shapley values. The data comes from [the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study](https://ffcws.princeton.edu/about). This work was carried out for Applied Machine Learning during Hilary Term 2024 in Oxford.
